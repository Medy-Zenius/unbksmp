    I think one of the worst moments in my stuttering days was when I went out for a haircut. I was with my brother and we were both going to get cuts. As every stutterer knows, you have times when you can speak perfectly fine and others it can come without warning, leaving you wondering what happened. At the hair cut place, the guy at the counter asked my phone number, which I spoke out clearly. He then asked who would get the haircuts. I quickly said my name, but couldn't make out my brother's name. I tried, and tried, saying, Daaaaaan....Ddddddaaaaaa. I couldn't help but think how stupid I sounded. The guy sharply implied, "you don't even know your brother's name?" My little brother finally came to my rescue after I pointed to him and he said his name for me. That was the shortest haircut I've ever had. Both my brother and I look at it and laugh now. It's the only thing you really can do.<br><br>
