   Dear sirs<br><br>

As a taxpaying citizen of Anytown, I am extremely displeased with the level of service offered by our public buses. It is so terrible I frequently use public transportation to get around Anytown as well as during my. We have several bus lines that are intended to provide convenient access to locations around town. This would be effective if the buses ran on a dependable schedule. In the past week, I have experienced six late buses on my commute and one that did not arrive at all.<br><br>

I hope that you will take my complaint into consideration. If you question my claims, I suggest you attempt to ride to work on one of your own buses for an entire month. Then you may see how frustrating it is.<br><br>

I would greatly appreciate hearing your plans for improving the bus system. Thank you very much for your time.<br><br>

Sincerely yours,<br>

Aicho<br><br>
