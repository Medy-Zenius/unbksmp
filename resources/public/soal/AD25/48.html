    Two Christmases ago, my family and I were in visiting relatives in L.A. (46 ) ... stayed at a tiny hotel and suddenly all four of us came down with the stomach flu. Our room was seriously like 400 square feet. You can imagine the mess and how (47) ... it was for 48 hours. Well, once we were slowly starting to feel better, we went down to the pool to try and eat something, and the kids (ages 1 and 5) wanted to go swimming. The two boys and I got in the elevator to go get our swim suits. Well, on the way up, the elevator stopped. Let me remind you that we were all on the tail end of the stomach flu. And yes, we were stuck in the elevator, on Christmas Day, for over an hour - me and two little kids. The elevator repair man got lost, then couldn't (48)... because it was a holiday. Finally, the fire department came and broke us out of the elevator. Luckily, none of us had to puke until we got out of the cramped quarters. Best Christmas. Ever<br><br>
