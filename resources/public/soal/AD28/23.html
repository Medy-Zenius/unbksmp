    <b>My House</b><br><br>

I live in a small house. It has five rooms. There are two bedrooms, a living room, a bathroom, and a kitchen. Although it is a small house, I love doing many activities in it.<br>

When the door is open, you will see the living room. It is a small room with only three chairs and a table. This is my favorite place for reading my comic collection.<br>

My bedroom is in the left side of the living room. In this room there is a night table next to the bed, TV, radio, and computer. When I was bored of studying, I usually play online games or chat with my cyber friends on Facebook and Twitter.<br>

Next to my bedroom is my mother's. I do not know for sure how it looks like because I hardly come into it. In the right side of the living room there is a kitchen. In the kitchen I have everything I need when I get hungry. It is really fun when my mother cooks. The smell of the dish fills the whole house.<br>

I know it is a very small house but it is the best place I have ever seen.<br><br>
