    <b>A Rabbit and Twenty Crocodiles</b><br>
Once upon a time, a rabbit wanted to cross a river, but he could not swim. After a while, he had an idea. He saw a boss of crocodiles swimming in the river. The rabbit asked him, "How many crocodile are there in the river?"<br>

The boss of crocodile answered, "We are twenty here".<br>

"Where are they?" the rabbit asked for the second time.<br>

"What is it for?" the boss crocodile asked.<br>

"The king of the jungle will grant a big prize because of your good, gentle and kind manner. I want to know the exact number of the crocodile here, so please make a line in order," said the rabbit.<br>

Then the boss of the Crocodiles called all his friends and asked them to do what the rabbit wanted. They make a line from one side to the other side of the river. After that, the rabbit started to count while jumping from one crocodile to another: one .... two .... three .... four .... until twenty. And finally, he thanked all of them because he had successfully crossed the river.<br>
