    <b>Diving in Bunaken Island</b><br><br>
Last year, I left New Zealand for Bunaken island. I went there with a group of New Zealand divers. Getting there was not quite easy.<br>

Soon after our arrival at Bunaken, we got a general briefing. It included a description about how to take pictures under water.<br>

Then, we began our diving. In our diving, we saw groups of tiny fish. In order to identify them, we needed a good guide. Without some knowledge of their habitat and behavior, it was difficult to identify.<br>

In summer, the trip was mostly enjoyable. This place is so impressive with its marine life.<br><br>
