   Dear Mr. Kumar,<br><br>
I have been a customer of your hotel and have always appreciated the excellent customer service you offer. Yet a recent unpleasant experience at your hotel has shaken my belief in your ability to provide top notch customer care all the time.<br>

I stayed in room 305 of your Mumbay hotel from November 3rd to November 8th. Throughout my stay I was served mediocre food. The bathroom fittings were faulty and the room service was pretty bad: they rarely changed my bed sheets or towels. Worse still, I had an extremely noisy neighbour who took great pleasure in entertaining visitors until 3 AM. I complained to the manager but that didn't improve the situation until the third day of my stay.<br>

I am writing to encourage you to improve your customer service as I don't want this experience to ruin my positive impression about your hotel. I just hope that these problems will be solved prior to my next visit.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Alena Darwis<br><br>
