<p>Yesterday night was the night of the fair, the
following day was holiday. The children at
Tim‟s school were really excited. They ran
down the path out of school as fast as they
could. Tim ran all the way home, and
changed into his jeans and sneakers.He ate
his dinner quickly, and sat at the window waiting
for his dad to come. He couldn‟t wait for
six o‟clock when the fair would begin. He
    has been saving his pocket money for weeks.</p>
<p>When Tim his family arrived at the fair, it
had just opened. Already there were crowds
of people swarming around foodstalls, displays
and dozens of rides. “Can I buy some
chips and a drink?‟ asked Tim, “Okay” sad
Tim‟s dad. “But hang on tightly to your
waller. There are a lot of people around.”
I‟II be fine.‟ said Tim impatiently.</p>
<p>He found a foodstall, and ordered his food.
When the man brought his chips and drink,
without thinking, Tim put his wallet on the
counter and picked up his food and drink.
When he glanced back, his wallet had vanished!
Tim desperately looked around him,
but is was no use. All his pocket money was
    gone.</p>
