My favorite thing is aquarium. It is a place in
which aquatic plants animals, particuraly fish,
are kept. The term is applied to single tanks
for home use in which fish are kept for their
decorative effect and interesting habits and
to public institutions with lanks for exhibition
and scientific study of aquatic life.<br>
I make home aquarium to simulate a natural
environment. Aquatic plants supply the oxygen
needed by the fish. but often an aerating
device is used to furnish additional oxygen.
Goldfish enjoy cool water, but the popular
tropical fish mush have water at a constant
    temperature of 22<sup>o</sup>C (72<sup>o</sup>F) or more. I must
keep the water pure and free of algae for
long peroids by sufficient aeration and by
keeping mollusks in the aquarium. A layer of
sand of gravel at the bottom of the tank will
hold the roots of such important aquatic
plants as tape grass, vallismeria spiral, and aid
in the removal of debris. My home aquarium
range in size from small fishbowls holding
two or three pets to huge tanks.
