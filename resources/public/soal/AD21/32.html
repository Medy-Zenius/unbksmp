Do you know that a giraffe may grow more
than six metres tall? Yes, the giraffe is a very
tall animal. In fact, it is the tallest animal in
the world.<br>
A giraffe has a very long neck. Unfortunatelly,
the giraffe cannot bend its neck easily.
Thus, when it wants to drink water at a pool,
the giraffe has to spread its fronts legs apart,
so it can reach the water.<br>
A giraffe feeds on plants only. Hence, it
can reach the leaves on trees esily because of
its height. Also, a giraffe has a very long
tongue abut 0,5 metre long. The giraffe uses
this long tongue skillfully to pick leaves off
plants and trees.<br>
This tall animal can protect iself very
well. It has a very good sense of smell and
sight. It can hear very well, too. Finally, it can
gallop very fast at a speed of 50 km.p.h
The giraffe's hind legs and long neck are
also very useful. For example, a giraffe can
kick its enemy with its legs or even hit out
with its long neck.
