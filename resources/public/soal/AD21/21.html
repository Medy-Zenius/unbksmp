Once upon a time there were two butterflies, Teri
and Roni. They are friends. Teri and Roni
had the same crown.<br>
One day, Kodi a frog, saw Teri and Roni
quarreling.<br>
“You took it!” No, I did not! said Teri.<br>
“Hey,what's the matter?” asked Kodi.<br>
“Teri stole my crown!” said Roni.<br>
“No. I didn't,” said Teri.<br>
“Yesterday, I still had my crown when she
came to visit me,” said Roni.<br>
“Today I cannot find the crown! Look, she is
wearing it!” Roni shouted.<br>
“My mom gave me this crown,” Teri explained.<br>
Kodi suggested they all go to Roni‟s house.<br>
“Where did you put it?” said Kodi to Roni.<br>
“I put it on the table,” Roni answered.<br>
They didn't find the crown.<br>
“Maybe, it fell down.”
Kodi looked under
the table.Nothing was there.<br>
“It was my favorite crown!” Roni sobbed.<br>
“I didn't steal yours, but if you like it so
much, you can have mine,”
Teri gave the crown.<br>
“Tt's here!" Kodi saw the crown behind the
curtain.<br>
Roni stopped crying. “Thank God. Kodi
found it!”<br>
“Sorry, Teri, I accussed you, I'am terrible
friend!”<br>
“It's OK, said Teri, “Let's say thanks to
Kodi!”
