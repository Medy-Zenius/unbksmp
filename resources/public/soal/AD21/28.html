Have you ever visited a place which made
you want to stay forever?<br>
I have. Last year, I went to Situ Cileunca. At
first, I thought the place was only the same
as other places in Bandung. But I was very
surprised to find that it was the most beautiful
place I've ever visited.<br>
There were fantastic meadows, a lake, and a
river. The meadow was very large. In the
middle of the meadow there were many
cows and sheep. All the animal were fat and
healthy because they could easily get some
grass in that large meadow. At the edge of
the meadow, there was a small river. The water in the river was very cold. But, the
sound of the streaming water was good to
hear, especialy in the evening.<br>
Not far away from the heard of cattle,
there was a lake. The lake wasn't too big,
but is ws very beautiful. The water was very
clear and clean. We could see many fish in
the lake.<br>
The most amazing thing was the water itself.
it was not cold although the weather
around was extremely freezing.<br>
Unfortunately, I stayed there for just three
days because we had go to back to Jakarta.
But I have promised myself to come back
later.
