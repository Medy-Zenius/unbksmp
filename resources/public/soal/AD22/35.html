Jeepneys are the most popular means of public transportation in the Philippines, originally made from US military jeeps left over from World War II and are known for their flamboyant decoration and crowded seating. <span style="text-decoration:underline">They</span> have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture.<br>

    Original jeepneys were simply <b>refurbished</b> military jeeps by Willys and Ford. Modern jeepneys are now produced by independently owned workshops and factories in the Philippines with surplus engines and parts coming from Japan. <br>
There are two classes of jeepney builders in the Philippines. The backyard builders which produce 1-5 vehicles a month, and the large volume manufacturer. which produce the large volume that supply parts as well as complete vehicles.<br><br>
