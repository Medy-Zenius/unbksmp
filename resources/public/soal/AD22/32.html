Many and many years ago, two Micmac warriors from rival villages got into a terrible battle, back and forth on the banks of a small creek, tearing at each other with their knives. Suddenly, one of the warriors slipped on the muddy bank and fell into the waters of the creek. His bloody knife slipped from his hand and sank down and down to the bottom, landing upon a rock just beyond his reach. The warrior strained his pain-wracked body towards the knife as his blood filled the waters of the creek, but it was just beyond his fingertips but no matter how he stretched, it always slipped out of reach.<br>

The fallen man's people found him a few hours later and tenderly rescued his body from the rippling waters of the creek. But when they tried to <b>retrieve</b> his bloody knife from the rock beneath him, it always slipped beyond their reach, though the creek was not deep.<br>

Many and many years have passed since that bloody day by the creek, and still the blood-stained knife lies beneath the rippling waters of the creek. Whenever anyone tries to reach it, the knife slips out of reach. For this reason, the creek is called Wokun - meaning "knife" by the Micmac people, and the white men call it "Bloody Creek".<br><br>
