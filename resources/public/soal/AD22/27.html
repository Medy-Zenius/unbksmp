AN ASS, belonging to a herb-seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released  from his present service and provided with another master.  Jupiter, after warning him that he would grant his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker.<br>

Shortly afterwards, finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter told him that it would be the last for granting it.<br>

Soon after, the Ass found that he had fallen into worse hands, a tanner,  said, groaning:  "It would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him."<br><br>
