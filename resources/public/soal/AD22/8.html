<p>On March 5, 2014, I bought a Perfect Muffin Kit from your store at Midfield Mall but I was so dissapointed after all.</p>

<p>After I tried out product, I did not live up to its claim promised in the box as "Perfect Muffins Every Time."
    In fact, the muffins I made were far from perfect. I followed the directions included in the package very
    carefully but still I discovered that <span style="text-decoration:underline">they</span> were not perfect.</p>

<p>I would appreciate a full refund ($3.99) for this product as soon as possible. Enclosed are the receipt,
    the empty box, and one of the un-perfect muffins so that you can experience it for yourself. Thank you for your
    <b>prompt</b> attention to this matter.</p>

Sincerely,<br>
