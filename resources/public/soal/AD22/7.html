On March 5, 2014, I bought a Perfect Muffin Kit from your store at Midfield Mall but I was so dissapointed after all.<br>

After I tried out product, I did not live up to its claim promised in the box as “Perfect Muffins Every Time.” In fact, the muffins I made were far from perfect. I followed the directions included in the package very carefully but still I discovered that they were not perfect.<br>

I would appreciate a full refund ($3.99) for this product as soon as possible. Enclosed are the receipt, the empty box, and one of the un-perfect muffins so that you can experience it for yourself. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Michelle Bauer<br>
