    <b>Camping</b><br><br>

Last Saturday afternoon my schoolmates and I went camping. It was a school programme. We traveled by bus. From the parking lot, we must walk for about one and a half hour. The camping site is near a small river. We set up the camp next to it. It was getting darker and colder, so we built a fire camp.<br><br>
The next day, we spent our time observing plantation and insects while the girls were preparing meals. In the afternoon we went to the river and caught some fish for supper. At night, we held a fire camp night. We sang, danced, read poetry, played magic tricks, and even some of us performed a standing comedy.<br><br>

On Monday, we packed our bags and got ready to go home.<br><br>

    Why did they have to take a walk to reach the camp site?
