Dear Della,<br><br>

I want to write to you today to tell my most unhappy experiences. It happened on a Sunday night 2 weeks ago when I was preparing for my English test. It was 5 p.m. and I still had a lot of lessons to learn before taking that test. Then Aulia and Reta, my best friends, came over. They told me there was a party at Ika's house and they asked me to join them. At that time, I thought that it was the best decision I had ever made because I really had a lot of fun and got relax for a while.  When I got home, I was too tired to revise my lessons. I went to bed without hesitation.<br>

The morning after was the most terrible time for me. I hadn't revised my lessons yet, so I did badly on the English test. I got a mark 3 for that test. That was so bad because it was the worst mark I had ever got. I burst to tears right after I received my test back. At this time I really regretted going to Ika's party. If only time could have gone back to the night before!<br>

After school, I went home. When I saw my parents, I felt so ashamed of myself that I couldn't say a word. I promised myself that I would never let anything like this happen. From that point on, I always prepare my lessons carefully before school and revise them deeply before taking tests.<br>
What about you? Have you got any unforgettable experience that you would like to share with me? Write to me soon. I'm looking forward hearing from you.<br><br>

Yours,<br>
Zelin<br><br>
