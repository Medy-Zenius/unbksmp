    <b>Holiday in Semirang Waterfall</b><br><br>

Last Sunday, Erma and her classmates visited Semirang Waterfall in Ungaran. It was the first time for them to visit the waterfall.
When they arrived at the hill, they felt so fresh. The air was so pure and all they could see only green and green.<br><br>

In Ungaran, they took a little bit trekking to find the waterfall, because the distance was too far.<br><br>

After taking so far distance, they found Semirang Waterfall. What a beautiful waterfall. They enjoyed the nice water in the rain forest surrounding the waterfall.<br><br>

Hearing the sound of falling water made them peace and relax. It was also excellent drowning out background sound. Playing with the water made them feel so happy.<br><br>
