Butterflies are some of the World's most wondrous animals. Their beauty is seemingly a miraculous metamorphosis and apparently a carefree flight and all spark our imaginations.<br><br>

As advanced insects, butterflies and moths have a "complete" life cycle. This means that there are four separate stages, each of which looks completely different and serves a different purpose in the life of the insect. They are eggs, caterpillars, chrysalises, and colorful butterflies.<br><br>

Butterflies and moths are found in all continents except Antarctic, and scientists estimate that there are approximately 12-15,000 species of butterflies. In the United States and Canada, more than 750 species of butterflies have been recorded. Many species of a few kinds of butterflies are still being discovered.<br><br>
